Excited to announce my new open source project: 30+ Claude Code Tips from Basics to Advanced!

This is the result of my 9+ months of intensive use distilled into a single repo. It includes a custom status line script, cutting the system prompt in half, using Gemini CLI as Claude Code's minion, and Claude Code running itself in a container.

Check it out at github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips or in the article below.
